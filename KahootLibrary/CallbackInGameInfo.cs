 * Program:         CardsLibrary.dll
 * Module:          Shoe.cs
 * Author:          T. Haworth
 * Date:            March 9, 2021
 * Description:     Defines a WCF service contract called IShoe as well as 
 *                  a Shoe class that implements the service. This is just 
 *                  a slightly modified version of the earlier CardsLibrary 
 *                  example.
 *                  
 *                  Note that we had to add a reference to the .NET Framework 
 *                  assembly System.ServiceModel.dll.
 *
