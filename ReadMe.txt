How to Run the Example:

1.	Make sure you are running Visual Studio via "Run as Administrator"
2.	Build all projects before testing it.

	The solution has been configured so that all this will happen when you 
	click on the "Start" button in the toolbar.
3.	To execte multiple instances of the client it may work better to launch
	the client outside of Visual Studio by double clicking on the file
